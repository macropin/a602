# A602 3D Printer Firmware

This is a collection of Marlin firmwares for the Aworldnet Havit A602 Reprap Prusa i3.

See the branches for the actual firmwares.

NB, it is most likely that the 'soupaboy' firmware is more correct as it is based off a newer version
of Marlin and has more sane configs.

Caveat emptor: I have not tested any of these. Proceed with caution.
